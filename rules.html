			<h1>Welcome to Gotcha 2014.</h1>

			<p>The rules for Gotcha are simple. Catch or be caught. The student that survives the longest wins a rockin' T-shirt... and glory. Will this year's Gotcha winner be you?</p>

			<p>After Gotcha starts, your job is to find and tag your <strong>target</strong>. You stay in until you are tagged, at which point you are out, and cannot tag anymore. The goal is twofold: First, to amass as many tags as possible, and second, to stay in for as long as you can.</p>

			<h2>New Tagging System</h2>

			<p>This year, <strong>don't tell people your target once you've been tagged.</strong> Instead, tell your tagger your <strong>tag code</strong>, which is the two-character code on the Capture screen.</p>

			<p>If you've tagged someone, once you learn their tag code, enter the code into the text box and you will recieve your next target.</p>

			<p>Make sure to keep your tag code a secret.</p>

			<h2>The Game</h2>

			<p>The game begins at 8:30 AM on Monday, November 10, 2014. This website will not let you register a tag until that time. You can tag people between 8:30 AM and 5:45 PM each day; after the school day ends, you may not register any tags. <strong>On Veterans Day, Gotcha will begin at noon out of respect for the holiday.</p>

			<h2>Safety</h2>

			<p>There are some guidelines to make sure we are as safe as possible.</p>

			<ul>
				<li>No tagging on Centre Street or the surrounding sidewalk.</li>
				<li>No tagging on the field between Ware and Cox Library, in front of the AMC.</li>
				<li>No tagging in computer labs, classrooms, the Library, or the Skills Center.</li>
				<li>No tagging in Forbes Dining Hall, the admissions hallway, in any dorms, or in the Deans' office.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Breaking the Rules</h2>

			<p><strong>Any teacher has the power to permanently ban you from the game.</strong> If you are seen breaking any of the rules listed above, or acting in an unsafe manner, it will be at any teacher's discretion to ban you from the game.</p>

	<!-- The following Javascript code ensures that alerts fade out after 
	---- 5 seconds (5000 milliseconds). Since alerts can be present on any
	---- page, we include the javascript with each request. And since the
	---- script isn't dependent on external libraries like JQuery, it can be
	---- inlined to minimize the number of HTTP requests that the browser
	---- makes, which will reduce load times all around. -->
