	<h1>About This Website</h1>

	<p>This website was made in a week. It uses Laravel 4.2 on a cool new Linode server with Forge helping out. The domain name uses a fancy new TLD â€” gotcha.ninja instead of gotcha.com or gotcha.net or something less cool.</p>

	<p>If there are problems, email James Little. Again, I made this in a week, so it's more likely than not that there will be a problem. I'll try to fix it as quickly as possible if you email me nicely.</p>
